# Skin Titan Coconut

A skin made for toddlers and young children.

This goal of this skin is to make something as accessible as Netflix of Prime Video. It is not meant to have many features, and is meant to only play video.

This skin is a fork of Titan Bingie Mod, customized to make the UI simpler and more limited.

## Story

My oldest child loves watching shows on Netflix and Prime Video (on a FireTV). But we also own a lot of old, but good content, but he'll only watch that if we set it up.

Watching DVDs is a lot more work than Netflix (and the kids scratch the disks), ripped shows are better than DVDs, but the Kodi UI is not great for child just learning to read. It also has a lot of features that he does not need. And one wrong step and it's hard to get back to the right place.

So this is a way to make watching old content attractive to him.

(Also, we can make changes that will make it harder to suck him in. Things like no autoplay, showing the time in the UI, etc.)

## Development

This is a set of minor *tweaks* on top of Bingie Mod. They are as follows:

- [ ] Remove several items from the main menu: Live TV, My List, Search (removed by default but can be enabled)
- [ ] Trim down the categories (such as Critically accalimed TV shows)
- [x] Remove Netflix logos
- [ ] Remove liked/ratings from the view
- [ ] Make the OSD more like standard Kodi (bring back stop button, show current time)
- [ ] Add 10 second skip steps (may be possible by adjusting settings)
- [ ] Default to "episodes" format for shows
- [ ] Tweak episodes mode to load all shows by default

I'm also pondering:
- [ ] Change the color scheme
- [ ] Remove because you watched 
- [ ] Hide recently added by default - but make it optional
- [ ] Hide generic TV categories by default (Drama, etc.) - but make it optional

If I become independently wealthy and have unlimited free time, I would also like to support reading episode information from text files in the same directories as video. This way the data does not depend on accessing 3rd party services, and it can easily modified & consistent across devices, say if Kodi is on a phone.

Thank you @AchillesPunks and @HugoL for Titan Bingie Mod. Without something so great and close to what I wanted I would not have even tried making this.
And thank you to @marcelveldt and @cartmandos for Titan and Titan Bingie, which laid the foundation for everything.
